# Letterboxd Directors

I love Letterboxd. I love the (pro) stats feature, seeing the list of directors who's work I've seen and the amount of their films that I've logged. The stats page is unfrotunately limited to the ~10 directors with the most logged films. Went & wrote this Rails app to scrape the Letterboxd site per provided username, compile a list of your logged films, and using TMDB API, compile the full list of your logged films per director. 

Would love to integrate this with their API if that's released to the public someday üôè
