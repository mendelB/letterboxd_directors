# Letterboxd Directors

I love Letterboxd. I love seeing -in the Stats section- the list of directors whos work I've seen and the amount of their films I've logged. I just wanted to see them *all*, not just the top 10 or whatever. Wrote a simple lil Rails app that accepts the CSV of your Letterboxd exported data, and uses the TMDB API to compile the full list of directors. 

This is a super rough and tumble draft. Much work needed. Perhaps one day...
